    <b>libarchive</b><br>
    <p> The libarchive distribution as a whole is Copyright by Tim Kientzle and is subject to the copyright notice reproduced at the bottom of this file.</p>
    <p>Each individual file in this distribution should have a clear copyright/licensing statement at the beginning of the file.  If any do not, please let me know and I will rectify it.  The following is intended to summarize the copyright status of the individual files; the actual statements in the files are controlling.</p>
    <p>PExcept as listed below, all C sources (including .c and .h files) and documentation files are subject to the copyright notice reproduced at the bottom of this file.</p>
    <p>The following source files are also subject in whole or in part to a 3-clause UC Regents copyright; please read the individual source files for details:</p>
    <p>libarchive/archive_entry.c</p>
    <p>libarchive/archive_read_support_filter_compress.c</p>
    <p>libarchive/archive_write_add_filter_compress.c</p>
    <p>libarchive/mtree.5<p>
    <p>The following source files are in the public domain: libarchive/archive_getdate.c </p>
    <p>The build files---including Makefiles, configure scripts, and auxiliary scripts used as part of the compile process---have widely varying licensing terms.  Please check individual files before distributing them to see if those restrictions apply to you.</p>
    <p>I intend for all new source code to use the license below and hope over time to replace code with other licenses with new implementations that do use the license below.  The varying licensing of the build scripts seems to be an unavoidable mess.</p>
